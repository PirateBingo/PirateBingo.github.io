    <h1>Jack’s Webpage</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a computer science major. I enjoy working on creative projects and learning new technologies that make life more interactive and efficient. In my free time, I like to learn new stuff by reading and taking notes. I also like designing circuit boards and studying music theory.</p>

    <h2>Useful Resources</h2>
    <p>Here are some useful links I often visit:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">MDN Web Docs</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs/ch10.pdf">Regular Expressions (extremely useful programming construct)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://ntoll.org/article/species-counterpoint/">Species Counterpoint (formula for writing great melodies)</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cell Type Comparison</h2>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Cell Type</th><th>Description</th><th>More Info</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Eukaryotes</td><td>Organisms whose cells have a membrane-bound nucleus</td><td><a href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/eukaryote-eucariote-294/">Nature Article</a></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Prokaryotes</td><td>A single-celled organism whose cell lacks a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles</td><td><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/prokaryote">Sciencedirect Article</a></td></tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Keyboard Shortcut for Emojis in Windows</h2>
    <p>In HTML you can use symbol shortcuts like &hearts;(&amp;hearts) and &infin;(&amp;infin). What's also cool is that you can access Emojis on windows using the <i>WIN + .</i> keyboard combination. I never knew that until recently.
    <h2>Gallery</h2>
    <p>Here's a funny photo I took of my dog Maisie:</p>
    <img src="images/maisie.jpg" alt="Maisie" width="300">
    <p>Our family had a DNA test done on her, and we found out she's a chihuahua/pomeranian mix. She has a face for radio.</p>
